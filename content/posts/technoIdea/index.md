## A Website To The Company 

During our visits to three different public companies, I observed how daily operations are handled on the ground and how technology, or the lack of it, affects efficiency. The companies included a small but busy ice plant, a retail grocery store, and a local logistics service provider. Each company had steady customer demand and hardworking employees, yet their systems were still highly manual. Orders were written on paper, phone calls were the primary communication method, and scheduling often depended on memory or handwritten logs. While these methods work, they also create delays, confusion, and missed opportunities. From an Information Technology perspective, I saw clear areas where simple but well-designed systems could significantly improve operations.

The ice plant stood out the most because it directly connects to my personal interest in creating a solution. The plant is relatively small but serves many regular customers such as stores, market vendors, and event suppliers. Orders are placed through phone calls, and staff members manually list the customer’s name, quantity of ice, delivery address, and requested time. Delivery assignments are then communicated verbally to truck drivers. While the staff are experienced and capable, the process depends heavily on human memory and handwritten notes. During busy hours, multiple calls can come in at once, increasing the risk of incorrect quantities, missed deliveries, or delayed scheduling. There is no centralized digital dashboard showing total daily demand, delivery routes, or real-time inventory levels.

A practical technological innovation for the ice plant would be a web-based ordering and logistics management system. Customers could create accounts and place orders through a simple website or mobile-friendly platform. The system would allow them to select delivery date, time, and quantity. Once submitted, orders would automatically be stored in a central database. On the administrative side, a dashboard could display all incoming orders, total ice production required for the day, and delivery schedules. The system could also generate optimized delivery routes using basic routing algorithms. For example, trucks could be assigned based on geographic zones, reducing fuel consumption and delivery time. Drivers could access their schedules through a simple mobile interface that lists customer names, quantities, and locations.

This system would provide multiple benefits. First, it reduces reliance on phone calls, which can interrupt workflow and create bottlenecks. Second, it minimizes human error because orders are directly entered by customers into the system. Third, it creates a digital record of transactions that can be used for forecasting demand trends. Over time, data analytics could show peak seasons, high-demand locations, and customer buying patterns. This information could help the plant plan production more efficiently. From a cybersecurity standpoint, proper authentication, encrypted communication (HTTPS), and secure database management would be necessary to protect customer information. Since I use Ubuntu and prefer practical tools, such a system could be developed using a Java backend (such as Spring Boot), a MySQL or PostgreSQL database, and a simple frontend framework. Hosting could initially be on a cloud platform with proper backups and firewall configurations.

The second company we visited was a grocery store that handles both walk-in customers and small wholesale buyers. The store uses a basic point-of-sale system, but inventory updates are done manually at the end of the day. Employees count stock physically and compare it to printed sales records. This process is time-consuming and prone to discrepancies. There were also situations where popular items ran out unexpectedly because there was no automatic low-stock alert. Customers sometimes asked for products that were no longer available, which reduced customer satisfaction.

For the grocery store, implementing a fully integrated inventory management system would significantly improve efficiency. Each product could be assigned a barcode linked to a database. When items are scanned at checkout, stock levels would automatically update in real time. The system could include a threshold alert feature that notifies management when stock falls below a certain level. Additionally, a simple analytics module could show fast-moving and slow-moving products. This would help the store optimize shelf space and purchasing decisions. From a broader perspective, connecting the system to supplier databases could enable semi-automated reordering when stock is low. Such automation reduces waste, prevents stockouts, and improves overall profitability.

The third company, a logistics service provider, manages deliveries for small businesses. Scheduling is done through spreadsheets and phone coordination. While spreadsheets are helpful, they are not collaborative in real time unless connected to cloud services. Drivers sometimes receive last-minute updates through phone calls, which can cause confusion if multiple changes occur. There was also no GPS tracking system integrated into operations, making it difficult to monitor delivery progress.

A technological upgrade for this company would involve implementing a centralized logistics management platform. This platform would integrate order entry, scheduling, route optimization, and real-time GPS tracking. Managers could assign deliveries digitally, and drivers could confirm completion through a mobile application. GPS data would allow real-time tracking and better customer communication. Customers could receive automatic notifications when their delivery is on the way. This improves transparency and builds trust. In addition, data collected from routes and delivery times could be analyzed to identify inefficiencies or recurring traffic issues. Over time, machine learning algorithms could even suggest optimized schedules based on historical data.

Across all three companies, a common pattern emerged: operations rely heavily on manual processes that depend on individual experience rather than structured systems. While human experience is valuable, it should be supported by digital tools that reduce repetitive work and improve accuracy. The key is not to overcomplicate systems. For small and medium enterprises, solutions must be affordable, scalable, and easy to maintain. Cloud-based systems with subscription models can reduce upfront infrastructure costs. Open-source technologies can also minimize licensing expenses. However, alongside innovation, cybersecurity must be prioritized. Firewalls, regular system updates, role-based access control, and data encryption are essential to protect business and customer data.

From an Information Systems perspective, these observations highlight the importance of aligning technology with business processes. Technology should not simply replace manual tasks; it should enhance decision-making and create new opportunities. For the ice plant in particular, a web-based ordering and truck management system is not just about convenience. It is about transforming the workflow into a data-driven operation. With proper implementation, the plant could scale its customer base without significantly increasing administrative workload. Delivery efficiency would improve, fuel costs would decrease, and customer satisfaction would rise due to reliable scheduling.

In conclusion, visiting these companies demonstrated how technology can bridge the gap between traditional operations and modern efficiency. The ice plant can benefit from an online ordering and automated delivery management system. The grocery store can improve inventory accuracy through integrated barcode and stock tracking systems. The logistics provider can enhance coordination and transparency through centralized digital scheduling and GPS integration. These innovations are practical, achievable, and aligned with current Information Technology practices. By implementing structured, secure, and scalable systems, these businesses can increase productivity, reduce errors, and remain competitive in a rapidly evolving market environment.
