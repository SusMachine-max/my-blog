      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-website-to-the-company&#34;&gt;A Website To The Company&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During our visits to three different public companies, I observed how daily operations are handled on the ground and how technology, or the lack of it, affects efficiency. The companies included a small but busy ice plant, a retail grocery store, and a local logistics service provider. Each company had steady customer demand and hardworking employees, yet their systems were still highly manual. Orders were written on paper, phone calls were the primary communication method, and scheduling often depended on memory or handwritten logs. While these methods work, they also create delays, confusion, and missed opportunities. From an Information Technology perspective, I saw clear areas where simple but well-designed systems could significantly improve operations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-first-face-off&#34;&gt;The First Face-off&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This essay describes my first impression of a class in my course. It explains my experience during the first meetings and my thoughts about the professor. First impressions are important because they help students understand the learning environment and the teaching style used in the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the first day of class, I felt nervous and excited at the same time. It was the start of a new semester, and everything felt unfamiliar. I expected that the professor is strict. Some students looked confident, while others looked shy and quiet. I sat down and waited for the class to begin.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Enrollment System Review</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;using-oes-for-the-second-time&#34;&gt;Using OES for the second time&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Going into second semester, I got to experience the Online Enrollment System again, and honestly, I have a lot to say about it. It has been a long time since I first used the system to enroll myself in this university, and now that I am using it again, it made me stop and think: is there really anything to nitpick about it? That question came to mind because, overall, the system feels convenient for me and for many of my fellow students. As yanos, we usually just want things to work smoothly without too much effort, and in that sense, the Online Enrollment System does its job fairly well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
