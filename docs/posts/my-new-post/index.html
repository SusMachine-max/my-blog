<p>This essay describes my first impression of a class in my course. It explains my experience during the first meetings and my thoughts about the professor. First impressions are important because they help students understand the learning environment and the teaching style used in the classroom.</p>
<p>On the first day of class, I felt nervous and excited at the same time. It was the start of a new semester, and everything felt unfamiliar. I expected that the professor is strict. Some students looked confident, while others looked shy and quiet. I sat down and waited for the class to begin.</p>
<p>The classroom was quiet before the professor arrived. Some students were talking softly, and others were looking at their notebooks or phones. I felt unsure about what would happen in the class. I did not know the professor yet, and I did not know how the lessons would be taught.</p>
<p>When the professor entered the room, the mood of the class changed. He looked calm and relaxed. He walked slowly and greeted the class with a smile. His voice was clear and friendly. He did not look strict or intimidating. This made me feel more comfortable and less nervous.</p>
<p>The professor started speaking and introduced himself. He spoke in a simple and clear way. He made small jokes, and some students laughed. The class felt lighter after that. I felt that he was easy to talk to and not someone to be afraid of.</p>
<p>One of the first things the professor said surprised many students. He said that we would not learn a single thing from him. When I heard this, I felt confused and curious. I asked myself why a professor would say such a thing. Some students laughed, while others looked serious.</p>
<p>After seeing our reactions, the professor explained his statement. He said that his role is not to give us all the knowledge. He said that his job is only to facilitate learning. He explained that students must take responsibility for their own learning. This idea was new to me.</p>
<p>The professor said that learning does not happen just by listening. He said that learning happens when students think, ask questions, and search for answers. He wants students to be active, not passive. He wants us to learn how to learn on our own.</p>
<p>The professor often says that the things he says are lies. He uses the word “bakak” when he is joking. He usually smiles or laughs when he says it. This makes the class feel relaxed and fun. Students feel less pressure when he jokes like this.</p>
<p>At first, I thought it was strange that a professor would say he is lying. I wondered if he was serious or just joking. Later, I understood his purpose. He wants students to verify information instead of believing everything immediately.</p>
<p>The professor wants students to question what they hear. When he says something that sounds strange or wrong, he wants us to think about it. He wants us to ask if it is true or false. This helps students develop critical thinking skills.</p>
<p>He explained that in real life, not everything we hear is true. People can give wrong information. Because of this, students must learn how to check facts. The professor uses lies in a playful way to teach this important lesson.</p>
<p>Before our first class meeting, the professor asked us to answer a survey. The survey asked about our skills, experiences, and expectations for the class. He explained that he would use the survey results to plan the workload and activities.</p>
<p>I appreciated that the professor used a survey. It showed that he cared about the students. He wanted to understand our level and abilities. He did not assume that all students are the same. This made the class feel more fair and student focused.</p>
<p>The professor explained that the amount of work in the class would depend on the survey results. He said that he does not want to overload students. He wants the workload to match our skills and time. This made me feel respected as a student.</p>
<p>The professor is very chill, but he is also serious. He jokes and laughs, but he takes learning seriously. He expects students to do their work properly. He values effort, honesty, and responsibility. He is friendly, but he is not careless.</p>
<p>I like this balance in his personality. The class feels relaxed, but students still understand the importance of learning. This balance helps students enjoy the class while staying focused on their goals.</p>
<p>His teaching style is different from what I experienced before. Some teachers explain everything step by step. This professor does not do that. He gives ideas and questions, then lets students explore and find answers on their own.</p>
<p>This teaching method can be difficult at first, especially for first-year students. Some students may feel confused or unsure. However, this method encourages independence. It teaches students to take control of their learning.</p>
<p>The professor believes that students should not depend fully on the teacher. He wants us to search for information, read books, and use trusted sources. He wants us to practice learning skills that will help us in the future.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the professor’s jokes and lies can confuse students. A student might think he is not serious about teaching. However, if students listen carefully, they will understand his message. He uses humor to keep students engaged.</p>
<p>I think the professor teaches this way because we are first-year students. He wants to prepare us for university life. He wants us to understand that college learning is different from high school learning.</p>
<p>In university, students must be responsible for their education. Maybe the professor wants us to learn this lesson early. He wants us to build good study habits and a strong mindset.</p>
<p>The professor also encourages class participation. He asks questions and gives students time to answer. He listens to different opinions and respects them. He does not judge students quickly, which makes them feel safe to speak.</p>
<p>I noticed that many students feel comfortable in his class. They ask questions and share ideas. They laugh and participate in discussions. This creates a positive learning environment for everyone.</p>
<p>When students feel comfortable, learning becomes easier. Students are more open to new ideas. They are not afraid of making mistakes. This helps improve understanding and confidence.</p>
<p>Another good thing about the professor is his honesty. He clearly explains his teaching style and expectations. He does not pretend to know everything. This honesty helps build trust between the professor and the students.</p>
<p>The idea that learning is the student’s responsibility is very important. At first, it sounds difficult and scary. Over time, it becomes empowering. It teaches students discipline and self motivation.</p>
<p>The professor teaches indirectly. Instead of giving direct answers, he teaches students how to find answers. He teaches research skills and critical thinking. These skills are useful in all subjects and in daily life.</p>
<p>Not all students may like this teaching style. Some students prefer clear instructions and direct lessons. Everyone has a different learning style. This difference is normal and understandable.</p>
<p>However, I believe that this approach has many benefits. It prepares students for future challenges. It helps students become independent thinkers who can solve problems on their own.</p>
<p>In my experience, this class made me more curious. I listen carefully during lessons. I think more deeply about what the professor says. I feel more involved in the learning process.</p>
<p>The professor’s use of humor makes the class enjoyable. The word “bakak” became a reminder to question information. It reminds students not to accept things blindly.</p>
<p>I also feel that the professor respects his students. He treats us like responsible individuals. He trusts us to do our work. This trust motivates me to work harder and improve.</p>
<p>Overall, my first impression of this class is positive. The professor is friendly, serious, and thoughtful. He challenges students to think and encourages curiosity.</p>
<p>In conclusion, my first impression of my professor is that he is different but effective. He uses humor and indirect teaching to help students learn. He believes that learning comes from the student. He guides us but does not carry us. I look forward to learning more in his class and discovering the truth behind his “bakak.”</p>
